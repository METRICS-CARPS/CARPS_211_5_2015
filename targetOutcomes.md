For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for behavioural data only.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Behavioral data. For all participants as a group, accuracy was higher for RVF than for LVF words, although better-than-chance accuracy was seen in both visual fields (RVF: 81%; LVF: 75%). The same pattern held regardless of familial sinistrality: for FS– participants, RVF accuracy was 80% and LVF accuracy was 73%; for FS+ participants, RVF accuracy was 82% and LVF accuracy was 77%. Results of the ANOVA with factors of familial sinistrality, visual field, and grammaticality showed main effects of visual field, F (1, 62) = 37.39, p < .001, and grammaticality, F (1, 62) = 18.51, p < .001, but no effect of familial sinistrality (p = .3). There was also no Visual Field × Grammaticality interaction (p = .8) or familial sinistrality interactions (ps > .3).
